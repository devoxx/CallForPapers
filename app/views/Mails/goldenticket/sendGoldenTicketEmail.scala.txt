Dear @webuser.firstName

Congratulations! By purchasing a Blind Bird ticket for Devoxx PL 2017 you can now help shape the program.
                            
Community and crowdsourced content is already a core strand of the Devoxx DNA. Now with this new initiative
you’ll be given special access to our database where you can rate any or, for the brave, all talks proposed
during the Call for Papers period, which runs until 28th February, 2017. Your ratings will then be used
by the crack team we’ve assembled for the program committee to help shape the final schedule
for the conference in June.
                            
This privilege is only open to people buying Blind Bird tickets!

To access the ratings tool, go to http://cfp.devoxx.pl@routes.GoldenTicketController.authenticate() and use
the email address we've sent this to and your unique access code : @webuser.password

We’ve always said this is your event and now we’re really giving more power to you. We hope you’ll help us shape your conference :-)
                            
And, by the way, thanks for buying a blind bird ticket. It shows us you have faith that we’ll deliver another amazing event, even before you’ve seen the program. We really appreciate it, it means a lot to know the community trusts us, so cheers.

Happy rating,

The Devoxx Team
