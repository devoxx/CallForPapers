 <p>We're sorry to inform you that none of your proposals has been accepted for @Messages("longYearlyName").</p>
 <p>The program committee has received more than 670 proposals for 154 available slots. As you can imagine, the selection of speakers wasnâ€™t an easy task, considering that we received a lot of very interesting propositions for the conference. We would like to thank you for your time and we hope to see you as an attendee on @ConferenceDescriptor.current().timing.firstDayEn, at @Messages("longName").</p>
