We're sorry to inform you that none of your proposals has been accepted for @Messages("longYearlyName").
The program committee has received more than 670 proposals for 154 slots. As you can imagine, the selection of speakers
was a quite uneasy task, considering that we received a lot of very interesting applications for the conference.
We would like to thank you for your time and we look forward to see you on @ConferenceDescriptor.current().timing.firstDayEn, at @Messages("longName").

The @Messages("longName") program committee.
